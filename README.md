# Organizer  

A simple program that will help you organize a folder by moving your files to another folder you specify.  
By specifying a file extension you filter the files moved.

## Why would you use this?  
* Because your folder is full of files and everytime you want to organize the folder, the explorer gets slow or crashes (My case)
* Because you want a faster alternative of moving all your files from a directory to another

## How to run?
Go to the executable directory via command line and use organizer.exe --help  
It will give you a small documentation of how to use it, extension argument must contain a dot at the start (example: ".txt"), working directory must be a valid, existent path and the output directory must be a valid path, if the folder doesn't exist, it will be created.
